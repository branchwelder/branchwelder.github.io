Hello! I'm Hannah, welcome to my domain! I am a PhD student in the department of [Human Centered Design and Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I'm advised by [Dr. Nadya Peek](http://infosyncratic.nl/), and I work in her lab, [Machine Agency](https://depts.washington.edu/machines/). I am interested how people use machines to make digital things physical. I did my undergraduate degree in Engineering with Computing at [Olin College](http://www.olin.edu/), and I was born and raised in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.

_I like colors, leave me alone!_
