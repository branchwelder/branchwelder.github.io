Slice-it was my undergraduate senior capstone project, which was sponsored by Solidworks Apps for Kids.

<!-- The Slice It app is part of the SOLIDWORKS Apps for Kids suite. It will allow users to explore the geometrical potential of planar forms coming together to form a shape. Using Shape It, users should be able to virtually create their model before Slice It takes the model and "slices" it into planar pieces that fit together. Drawing from topics familiar to children such as origami, model making, and sewing patterns, the language and examples should be accessible to young minds and hands. Like the other Apps for Kids apps, the goal is to engage young minds in the field of engineering and design and to physically create a 3D object using 2D materials without expensive or unattainable equipment.

Slice It is a web-app that fits into the existing SOLIDWORKS Apps for Kids Suite. It seeks to fill the gap between the creation of digital forms and assembly of the models in the real world. Our goal was to create a tool that can create high-fidelity representations of these models without requiring access to complex tools.

Once a model has been created in Shape It (another existing AFK app), the user “slices” the model with Slice It and prints it on a two dimensional surface for cutting and assembly. Slice It has the added bonus of being compatible with both normal printers as well as laser cutters, allowing for greater precision and ease of assembly if the user has access to the equipment. -->
