        // This little script is used to trick github pages into hosting single page apps.
        // It's used along with a bit of code in index.html. If we navigate to a route (in the address bar) 
        // other than the pages site's base domain, github doesn't know what do do with it. However, we can
        // customize the 404 page that is shown, so we use this to redirect the browser to index.html with the 
        // appropriate url so the clientside router can handle it. Neat! Also this file has to be above 512
        // bytes for some reason which is why I am typing this extremely long comment.
