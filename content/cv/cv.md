## Research Experience

### Machine Agency

- 2018 - present
- depts.uw.edu/machines
- PI: Nadya Peek
- My PhD research is largely motivated by my interest in workflow development for creative practice. High-level research questions that guide my inquiry include: "How do practitioners develop workflows?" and "How might we support their practice?" This interest is particularly well aligned with practice in the domain of digital fabrication, but extends to other domains such as laboratory science or cooking. I adopt an ethnographic approach to learn from practitioners and draw on my training as a software engineer to prototype new tools and systems to support their practice. In the future, I am interested in conducting long-term system evaluations with expert practitioners.

### DXARTS Softlab

- January 2022 - Present
- dx-softlab.com
- PI: Afroditi Psarra
- I joined a directed research group within the DXARTS Softlab where I am developing new tools for CNC textile manufacturing on knitting and embroidery machines.

### Klavins Lab, DARPA SD2

- June 2020 - December 2021
- klavinslab.org
- PIs: Eric Klavins and Benjamin Keller
- I joined a project funded by DARPA that aimed to explore new ways of communicating and collaborating between biology laboratories, primarily through development of a new common protocol language (PAML). I worked with biologists to prototype new ways of authoring and visualizing laboratory protocols.

### Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching (CELT)

- January 2019 - April 2019
- depts.uw.edu/celtweb
- PI: Cindy Atman
- I completed a research rotation with the Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching. We conducted a qualitative analysis of interview data from a study of domain experts who were asked to complete a design task. We investigated how experts leveraged their particular expertise to generate ideas and question the task's constraints, and compared approaches between experts who worked inside and outside the domain of the design task.

## Industry Experience

### Google: Stadia

- Summer 2018
- Waterloo, ON
- Software Engineering Intern
- I developed the first iteration of the game asset upload flow for the Stadia developer tools team. I also assisted in building out various features of the Stadia partner portal pre-launch.

### Google: Chrome Speed Operations

- Summer 2017
- Mountain View, California
- Software Engineering Intern
- I designed and implemented the frontend and backend of a new feature for the Chrome Performance Dashboard that visualized Chrome performance benchmarks across devices.

### Google: Engineering Productivity

- Summer 2016
- Boulder, Colorado
- Software Engineering Intern
- I designed and implemented a customizable and extensible dashboard webapp to display widgets important to a Google engineer's daily workflow.

### National Astronomical Observatory of Japan: Subaru Telescope

- Summer 2015
- Hilo, HI
- Software Engineering Intern
- I rewrote the best-fit focusing programs for the observatory's Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS) instrument. After interviewing astronomers to understand their user needs, I developed a visualization of the instrument focus fit and integrated it into the existing observation control system.

### 'Imiloa Astronomy Center

- Summer 2014
- Hilo, Hawaii
- Visual Media Intern
- I created an immersive virtual tour of 13 observatories on Mauna Kea for display in the 'Imiloa astronomy center museum and planetarium. I spent weeks on the 14000-foot summit taking high-resolution photos, which I stitched into spherical panoramas. I created the interactive tour in PanoTour Pro.
