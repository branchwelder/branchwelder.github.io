# Jubilee

[Jubilee](https://jubilee3d.com/) is multi-tool changing motion platform developed by my former labmate [Joshua Vasquez](http://www.doublejumpelectric.com/). I helped build some of the demonstration applications that were featured in our CHI 2020 paper. You can read the full paper [here](/papers/jubilee).

## Abstract

We present Jubilee, an open-source hardware machine with automatic tool-changing and interchangeable bed plates. As digital fabrication tools have become more broadly accessible, tailoring those machines to new users and novel workflows has become central to HCI research. However, the lack of hardware infrastructure makes custom application development cumbersome. We identify a need for an extensible platform to allow HCI researchers to develop workflows for fabrication, material exploration, and other applications. Jubilee addresses this need. It can automatically and repeatably change tools in the same operation. It can be built with a combination of simple 3D-printed and readily available parts. It has several standard head designs for a variety of applications including 3D printing, syringe-based liquid handling, imaging, and plotting. We present Jubilee with a comprehensive set of assembly instructions and kinematic mount templates for user-designed tools and bed plates. Finally we demonstrate Jubileeâ€™s multi-tool workflow functionality with a series of example applications.
