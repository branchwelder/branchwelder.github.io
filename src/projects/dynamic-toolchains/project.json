  "description": "Dynamic Toolchains is an extensible event-driven dataflow environment I built early in my PhD. The project has gone through a few iterations, with the original goal being to make it easy to use off-the-shelf libraries together for interactive digital fabrication. While I've largely moved on from the project, it has been forked and used to create a browser-based implementation of CoilCAM, a toolpath design system for clay 3D printing.",
